## Important Constraints

### Development Workflow
- **Vibe Coding with Git Sync**: Development is performed in a "vibe coding" environment where changes are synchronized to servers via git. Testing and validation tasks should NOT be included in OpenSpec proposals as they are handled through the git synchronization workflow.

### Testing Strategy
- Tests are run on the server side after git synchronization
- Do not include testing/validation tasks in OpenSpec proposals
- Focus proposals on implementation tasks only
- Validation happens through the git-based workflow

## External Dependencies
[Document key external services, APIs, or systems]
